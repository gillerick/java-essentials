## Java Essentials

### Generics

An interface or class may be declared to take one or more type parameters, which are
written in angle brackets and should be supplied when you declare a variable belonging
to the interface or class or when you create a new instance of a class ``List<E>``

### Reference vs Primitive types

- Every type in Java is either a reference type or a primitive type. A reference type is any class, interface, or array
  type and are subtypes of class **Object**
- Conversion of a primitive type to the corresponding reference type is called _boxing_ and conversion of the reference
  type to the corresponding primitive type is called _unboxing_.
  
  | Primitive | Reference |
  |-----------|-----------|
  | byte      | Byte      |
  | short     | Short     |
  | int       | Integer   |
  | long      | Long      |
  | float     | Float     |
